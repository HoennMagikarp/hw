Literature review
    What are the main approaches? Comment on their novelty and technical depth.
    Divided trust into different targets of trust, then connect different trusts into one big piture of blockchain in sharing economy, to see what people trust and not trust. 
It is an interesting perspective as trust might be overlooked by profit/popularity, which means it has a pretty decent novelty. The technical depth is complex ut necessary, which makes the paper clear with it's wordings.
    What are the major strengths of the paper?
The paper utilises a lot of data from different sources, which ensures it has great authoritation.
    What are the major weaknesses of the paper?
    The targets of trust has not been well defined, which means they might not be forming the full picture because there was no proofing on whether the targets are a whole of blockchain in sharing economy.
    What do you learn from the paper? It can be either a new research area, or a new problem, or the approach itself, or evaluation methodology, or the results.
    I learnt that trust can be an approach to business models, and that it is possible to combine so many different sources to one piece of academic paper.
    Other comments.
Blockchain cannot be centralised.
